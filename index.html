            Hi evry one and Wolcome to my web site.First of all my name is Ayah and I'm 26.
            I graduated from Yarmouk University in 2017 with a major in Telecommunications Engineering. I have not
            worked in a job yet, but I trained at Orange for three months and it was a wonderful and useful time I am
            now constantly looking for a job, so I try as much as possible to learn new skills to increase my knowledge
            and abilities.
